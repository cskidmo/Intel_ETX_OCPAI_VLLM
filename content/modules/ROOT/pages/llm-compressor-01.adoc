= LLM Compressor: Executive Guide

== Executive Summary

LLM Compressor powers Red Hat AI's collection of 490+ pre-compressed models, enabling 2-5X faster inference while preserving accuracy. Organizations typically deploy these ready-made compressed models rather than the compression library itself.

*Value Proposition:* Deploy fast, cost-efficient LLM inference using pre-optimized models without compression complexity.

'''

== What is LLM Compressor?

*Technical Foundation:* Open-source library applying post-training quantization, pruning, and sparsity techniques to reduce model size and accelerate inference while preserving accuracy.

*Business Application:* Enables organizations to run AI models faster and more cost-effectively without hardware upgrades or quality degradation.

*Integration:* Native compatibility with HuggingFace models and direct deployment to vLLM for production serving.

'''

== Core Technologies

=== Quantization Schemes

'''

== Deployment Scenarios

=== *Deploy When:*
* GPU memory constraints limit model deployment
* High inference costs impact operational budgets
* Latency requirements demand real-time performance
* Edge deployment requires resource optimization
* Infrastructure scaling reaches capacity limits

=== *Avoid When:*
* Current resources accommodate original model requirements
* Mission-critical accuracy tolerates zero degradation
* Specialized/fine-tuned models present higher risk
* Evaluation capabilities are unavailable
* Regulatory compliance requires unmodified models

=== *Assessment Required:*
* Current GPU memory vs model requirements
* Accuracy thresholds and evaluation capabilities
* Hardware compatibility (GPU generation, drivers)
* Performance requirements (latency, throughput)

'''

== Model Selection Framework

=== Red Hat AI Model Collection
*490 compressed models* across major architectures:
* Llama 3.1/3.2, Qwen, Mistral, Gemma families
* Parameter ranges: 1B to 70B+
* Multimodal support (vision, text-to-image)

=== Selection Criteria
. *Base Architecture*: Align with existing model preferences
. *Parameter Size*: Balance capability requirements with resource constraints
. *Quantization Scheme*: 
   - W8A8 for balanced performance (recommended baseline)
   - W4A16 for maximum compression
   - FP8 for newer GPU hardware
. *Application Type*: Text-only vs multimodal requirements
. *Community Validation*: Assess download metrics and activity

'''

== Accuracy Considerations

=== *Critical Requirement:* Accuracy loss varies unpredictably
* *Non-deterministic*: Superior models can underperform after quantization
* *Model-dependent*: Architecture affects quantization tolerance
* *Task-dependent*: Performance varies across different benchmarks

=== Performance Ranges
* *W8A8*: Typically minimal accuracy impact (Llama 3.1 70B baseline)
* *W4A16*: Variable results requiring thorough evaluation
* *Multimodal*: >99% accuracy recovery demonstrated (Llama 3.2 Vision)
* *Aggressive quantization*: Binary (5-20% loss), Ternary (2-10% loss)

=== *Mandatory Requirement:* Organizations must evaluate performance on specific data and use cases before production deployment.

== Implementation Workflow

=== Basic Process
[source,python]
----
# 1. Load model
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("model_name")

# 2. Define compression recipe
recipe = [
    SmoothQuantModifier(smoothing_strength=0.8),
    GPTQModifier(targets="Linear", scheme="W8A8")
]

# 3. Apply compression
oneshot(model=model, recipe=recipe, dataset=calibration_data)

# 4. Save and deploy
model.save_pretrained("compressed_model")
----

=== Deployment
[source,python]
----
# Load compressed model in vLLM
model = LLM("compressed_model_path")
output = model.generate("prompt")
